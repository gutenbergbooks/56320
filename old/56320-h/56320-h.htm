<p class="ac">INTRODUCTORY SURVEY.</p>


<p>In 1763 Great Britain was confronted with the momentous problem
of the readjustment of all her colonial relations in order to
meet the new conditions resulting from the peace of Paris, when
immense areas of territory and savage alien peoples were added
to the empire. The necessity of strengthening the imperial
ties between the old colonies and the mother country and reorganizing
the new acquisitions came to the forefront at this time and
led the government into a course soon to end in the disruption of
the empire. Certainly not the least of the questions demanding
solution was that of the disposition of the country lying to the
westward of the colonies, including a number of French settlements
and a broad belt of Indian nations. It does not, however, come
within the proposed limits of this study to discuss all the different
phases of the western policy of England, except in so far
as it may be necessary to make more clear her attitude towards
the French settlements in the Illinois country.</p>

<p>The European situation leading to the Seven Years War, which
ended so disastrously to French dominion, is too familiar to need
repetition. That struggle was the culmination of a series of continental
and colonial wars beginning towards the close of the
seventeenth century and ending with the definitive treaty of 1763.
During the first quarter of the century France occupied a predominating
position among the powers. Through the aggressiveness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Louis XIV and his ministers her boundaries had been pushed eastward
and westward, which seriously threatened the balance of power
on the continent. Until 1748 England and Austria had been in alliance
against their traditional enemy, while in the Austrian Succession
France had lent her aid to Prussia in the dismemberment of
the Austrian dominions,—at the same time extending her own power
in the interior of America and India. In the interval of nominal
peace after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, preparations
were begun for another contest. The astute diplomacy of Kaunitz
won France from her traditional enmity and secured her as an open
ally for Maria Theresa in her war of revenge.
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> While the European
situation was giving occasion for new alignments of powers, affairs
in America were becoming more and more important as between France
and England. Here for over a century the two powers had been rivals
for the territorial and commercial supremacy.</p>

<p>In North America the pioneers had won for her the greater
part of the continent,—the extensive valleys of the St. Lawrence
and the Mississippi with all the land watered by their tributaries.
The French claim to this region was based almost entirely upon
discovery and exploration, for in all its extent less than one
thousand people were permanently settled. Canada at the north and
the region about New Orleans on the extreme south containing the
bulk of the population, while throughout the old Northwest settlements
were few and scattering.
<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Trading posts and small villages
existed at Vincennes on the Wabash River, at Detroit on a river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of the same name, at St. Joseph near Lake Michigan and other isolated
places. Outside of Detroit, the most important and populous
settlement was situated along the eastern bank of the Mississippi,
in the southwestern part of the present state of Illinois. Here
were the villages of Kaskaskia, St. Phillippe, Prairie du Rocher,
Chartres village and Cahokia, containing a population of barely
two thousand people.</p>

<p>In contrast to this vast area of French territory and the
sparseness of its population were the British colonies, with more
than a million people confined to the narrow strip between the Alleghany
mountains and the Atlantic ocean. These provinces were
becoming comparatively crowded and many enterprising families of
English, Scotch Irish, and German extraction were pushing westward
towards the mountains. Each year saw the pressure on the western
border increased; the great unoccupied valley of the Ohio invited
homeseekers and adventurers westward in spite of hostile French
and Indians. By the fifth decade the barriers were being broken
through by constantly increasing numbers, and the French found
their possession of the West and their monopoly of the fur trade
seriously threatened.</p>

<p>To prevent such encroachments the French sought to bind their
possessions together with a line of forts extending from the St.
Lawrence down the Ohio valley to the Gulf of Mexico. It had indeed
been the plan of such men as La Salle, Iberville, and Bienville
to bring this territory into a compact whole and limit the
English colonies to the line of mountains. New Orleans and Mobile
gave France command of the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
River; Louisburg, Niagara, and Frontenac afforded protection for
Canada. The weak point for France was the Ohio valley, in the upper
part of which Virginia and Pennsylvania settlers had already
located. Celoron, who went down the Ohio in 1749, burying plates
of lead to signify French dominion, warning English settlers and
traders, and persuading the Indians to drive out the invaders of
their hunting grounds, saw the inevitableness of the conflict.
The American phase of the final struggle for colonial empire was
to begin in this region.
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In the early years of the war Great Britain and her ally met
with serious reverses every where, and it seemed probable that
France would be able to hold her line of defense in America. The
French colonies, however, were fundamentally weak. Being wholly
dependent upon the mother country, when the latter became absorbed
in the continental struggle to the exclusion of her interests in
her colonial possessions, defeat was inevitable. By 1758 the tide
was turning in America; this, together with the victories of Clive
in India and Frederick the Great at Rossbach and Leuthen, started
France on her downward road to ruin as a world power, and with the
transference of the American struggle to Canada by the capture of
Montreal and Quebec the war was at an end. In 1762 the financial
condition of France became so desperate that Choiseul was anxious
for peace and he found George III and Lord Bute ready to abandon
their Prussian ally, and even to give up the fruits of some of the
brilliant victories of 1762 which brought Spain to her knees.
<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The definitive treaty of Paris was signed February 10, 1763,
<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
by the terms of which France ceded to Great Britain all of Canada
and gave up her claim to the territory east of the Mississippi River,
except the city of New Orleans, adding to this the right of
the free navigation of the Mississippi. Spain received back Havana
ceding Florida to England in return. A few weeks before
signing the definitive treaty, France, in a secret treaty with
Spain ceded to her the city of New Orleans and the vast region
stretching from the Mississippi towards the Pacific. Thus was
France divested of practically every inch of territory in America.</p>

<p>The French colony in the Illinois country had been originally
established with the view of forming a connecting link between the
colonies in Louisiana on the south and Canada at the northeast.
La Salle himself had recognized the possible strategic value of
such an establishment from both a commercial and military standpoint.
<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Before any settlements had even been made on the lower
Mississippi, he and his associates had attempted in 1682 the formation
of a colony on the Illinois River, near the present site of
Peoria.
<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
This the first attempt at western colonization was a failure.
The opening of the following century saw the beginning of a
more successful and permanent colony, when the Catholic missionaries
from Quebec established their missions at Kaskaskia and Cahokia,
<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
near the villages of the Illinois Indians. They were soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
followed by hunters and fur traders, and during the first two decades
of the eighteenth century a considerable number of families
immigrated from Canada, thus assuring the permanancy of the settlement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the contemporaneous colony of Louisiana had grown
to some importance, and in 1717, when the Company of the West assumed
control of the province, the Illinois country was annexed.
Prior to this time it had been within the jurisdiction of Quebec.
This gave the Illinois country a period of prosperity, many new
enterprizes being undertaken. Shortly after its annexation to
Louisiana, Pierre Boisbriant was given a commission to govern the
Illinois country, and among his instructions was an order to erect
a fort as a protection against possible encroachments from the
English and Spanish. About 1720 Fort Chartres was completed and
became thereafter the seat of government during the French regime.
In 1721 the Company of the West divided Louisiana into nine districts,
<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
extending east and west of the Mississippi River between
the lines of the Ohio and Illinois rivers. In 1732 Louisiana passed
out of the hands of the Company of the West Indies, and, together
with the Illinois dependency, became a royal province.
<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It remained
in this status until the close of the Seven Years War.
During this period its relation with Louisiana had become economic
as well as political, all of its trade being carried on through
New Orleans, and the southern colony often owed its existence to
the large supplies of flour and pork sent down the river from the
Illinois country.

<p class="ac">THE OCCUPATION OF ILLINOIS.</p>


<p>By the treaty of Paris the title to the Illinois region passed
to Great Britain, but Fort Chartres was not immediately occupied.
Detachments of British troops had taken possession of practically
every other post in the newly ceded territory as early as
1760. The occupation of the forest posts of Green Bay, Mackinac,
St. Joseph, Ouitanon, Detroit, Fort Miami, Sandusky, Niagara and
others seemed to indicate almost complete British dominion in the
West. The transfer of the Illinois posts, however, remained to be
effected, and although orders were forwarded from France in the
summer of 1763 to the officers commanding in the ceded territory
to evacuate as soon as the English forces appeared,
<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> almost three
years elapsed before this was accomplished; for soon after the announcement
of the treaty of cession, that broad belt of Indian
tribes stretching from the fringe of the eastern settlements to
the Mississippi rose in open rebellion.
<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This unexpected movement
had to be reckoned with before any thought of the occupation
of the Illinois could be seriously entertained.</p>

<p>Of the two great northern Indian families, the Iroquois had
generally espoused the English cause during the recent war, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the Algonquin nations, living in Canada, and the Lake and Ohio regions,
had supported the French. At the close of the war the greater
portion of the French had sworn fealty to the English crown;
but the allegiance of their allies, the Algonquins, was at best
only temporary. It was thought that, since the power of France
had been crushed, there would be no further motive for the Indian
tribes to continue hostilities; but from 1761 there had been a
growing feeling of discontent among the western Indians. So long
as France and Great Britain were able to hold each other in check
in America, the Indian nations formed a balance of power, so to
speak, between them. England and France vied with each other to
conciliate the savages and to retain their good will. As soon,
however, as English dominion was assured, this attitude was somewhat
changed. The fur trade under the French had been well regulated,
but its condition under the English from 1760 to 1763 was
deplorable.
<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The English traders were rash and unprincipled men
<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
who did not scruple to cheat and insult their Indian clients at
every opportunity. The more intelligent of the western and northern
Indians perceived that their hunting grounds would soon be
overrun by white settlers with a fixed purpose of permanent settlement.
<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
This was probably the chief cause of the Indian uprising.
There remained in the forests many French and renegade traders and
hunters who constantly concocted insidious reports as to English
designs and filled the savage minds with hope of succor from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
King of France.
<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Many of the French inhabitance had since 1760 emigrated
beyond the Mississippi, because, as the Indians thought, they
feared to live under English rule.
<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> This doubtless contributed
something toward the rising discontent of the savages. Finally the
policy of economy in expenses, which General Amherst entered upon,
by cutting off a large part of the Indian presents, always so indispensable
in dealing with that race, augured poorly for the Indians's
future.</p>

<p>On the part of the mass of the Indians the insurrection was
probably a mere outbreak of resentment; but Pontiac, the great
chief of the Ottawas, had a clearer vision. He determined to rehabilitate
French power in the west and to reunite all the Indian
nations into one great confederacy in order to ward off the approaching
dangers. During the years 1761-1762 the plot was developed.
In 1762 Pontiac dispatched his emissaries to all the Indian nations.
The ramifications of the conspiracy extended to all the Algonquin
tribes, to some of the nations on the lower Mississippi and even
included a portion of the Six Nations. The original aim of the plot
was the destruction of the garrisons on the frontier, after which
the settlements were to be attacked. The attack on the outposts,
beginning in May, 1763, was sudden and overwhelming; Detroit, Fort
Pitt, and Niagara alone held out, the remainder of the posts falling
without an attempt at defense. Had the proclamation of 1763,
which aimed at the pacification of the Indians by reserving to them
the western lands, been issued earlier in the year, this devastating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
might have been avoided. Peaceful pacification was now out of
the question. During the summers of 1763 and 1764 Colonel Bouquet
raised the siege of Fort Pitt, penetrated into the enemy's country
in the upper Ohio valley region and completely subdued the Shawnee
and Delaware tribes upon whom Pontiac had placed every dependence.
Previous to Bouquet's second campaign, Colonel Bradstreet had advanced
with a detachment along the southern shore of Lake Erie,
penetrating as far west as Detroit, whence companies were sent to
occupy the posts in the upper lake region. In the campaign as a
whole the Bouquet expedition was the most effective. After the
ratification of a series of treaties, in which the Indians promised
allegiance to the English crown, the eastern portion of the rebellion
was broken.</p>

<p>It now remained to penetrate to the Illinois country in order
to relieve the French garrison. Pontiac had retired thither in
1764, after his unsuccessful attempt upon Detroit; there he hoped
to rally the western tribes and sue for the support of the French.
But as we shall see, his schemes received a powerful blow upon the
refusal of the commandants to countenance his pleas.</p>

<p>To what extent Pontiac was assisted by French intriguers in
the development of his plans may never be positively known. As has
already been pointed out, French traders were constantly among the
Indians, filling their minds with hopes and fears. That the plot
included French officials may be doubted; although Sir William
Johnson and General Gage seemed convinced that such was the case.
<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Their belief, however, was based almost wholly upon reports from
Indian runners, whose credibility as witnesses may well be questioned.
A perusal of the correspondence of the French officials
<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
residing in Illinois and Louisiana, and their official communications
with the Indians during this period goes far to clear them
of complicity in the affair.
<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>General Gage, who succeeded Amherst as commander-in-chief
of the British army in America in November, 1763, was convinced
that the early occupation of the western posts was essential,
<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
since it would in a measure cut off the communication between the
French and Indian nations dwelling in that vicinity. The Indians,
finding themselves thus inclosed would be more easily pacified.
But the participation in the rebellion of the Shawnee and Delaware
tribes of the upper Ohio river region precluded for a time the
possibility of reaching the Mississippi posts by way of Fort Pitt,
without a much larger force than Gage had at his command in the
east; and the colonies were already avoiding the call for troops.
<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
The only other available route was by way of New Orleans and the
Mississippi River whose navigation had been declared open to
French and English alike by the treaty of Paris. Little opposition
might be expected from the southern Indians toward whom a
much more liberal policy had been pursued than with the northern
tribes. Presents to the value of four or five thousand pounds had
been sent to Charleston in 1763 for distribution among the southern
nations which counter-acted in a large measure the machinations of
the French traders from New Orleans.
<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The Florida ports, Mobile
and Pensacola, were already occupied by English troops, and Gage
and his associates believed, that with the co-operation of the
French Governor of Louisiana a successful ascent could be made.
<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly in January, 1764, Major Arthur Loftus, with a detachment
of three hundred and fifty-one men from the twenty-second
regiment embarked at Mobile for New Orleans, where preparations
were to be made for the voyage.
<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
A company of sixty men from this
regiment were to be left at Fort Massac on the Ohio River, while
the remainder were to occupy Kaskaskia and Fort Chartres.
<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> At New
Orleans boats had to be built, supplies and provisions procured,
and guides and interpreters provided.
<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The expedition set out from
New Orleans February 27. Three weeks later the flotilla was attacked
by a band of Tonica Indians near Davion's Bluff, or Fort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Adams,
<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
about two hundred and forty miles above New Orleans. After
the loss of several men in the boats composing the vanguard, Loftus
ordered a retreat, and the expedition was abandoned. Depleted by
sickness, death and desertion the regiment made its way from New
Orleans back to Mobile.
<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Major Loftus placed the blame for the failure of his expedition
upon Governor D' Abadie and other French officials at New
Orleans.
<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
There is probably sufficient evidence, however, to warrant
the conclusion that his accusations against the Governor were without
foundation. The correspondence of D' Abadie, Gage, and others
indicates that official aid was given the English in making their
preparations for the journey,
<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
and letters were issued to the commandants
of the French posts on the Mississippi to render the English
convoys all the assistance in their power
<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. There may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
been some justification for the suspicion of Loftus that the intriguers
were at work, for the French as a whole were not in
sympathy with the attempt; the success of the English meant the
cessation of the lucrative trade between New Orleans and Illinois.
They were no doubt delighted at the discomfiture of the English
officer, for when some of the chiefs engaged in the ambuscade entered
New Orleans they were said to have been publicly received.
<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Granting, however, the machinations of the French, the reason
for the failure of Loftus may be found in part in the almost total
lack of precautions adopted before undertaking the journey. Governor
D' Abadie had given the English officer warning of the bad
disposition of a number of tribes along the Mississippi River, among
whom Pontiac had considerable influence, and had assured him
that unless he carried presents for the Indians, he would be unable
to proceed far up the river.
<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
The policy of sending advance agents
with convoys of presents for the Indians was successful the following
year when the Illinois posts were finally reached from the
east; but no such policy was adopted at this time.
<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> No action was
taken to counter-act any possible intrigues on the part of the
French. D' Abadie's advice was not heeded, and his prophecy was
fulfilled. General Gage in his official correspondence implied
that he did not think sufficient care had been exercised to insure
success, and expressed his belief that if Loftus would make use of
the "necessary precautions" he might get up to the mouth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Ohio with little interruption.
<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
This want of judgement, therefore,
accounts in a large degree for the unfortunate termination of the
plans of an approach from the south.</p>

<p>The news of the defeat of Loftus had two results. First, it
gave Pontiac renewed hope that he might be able to rally again the
western and northern Indians, and, with French assistance, block
the advance of the English. In the second place it led General
Gage to determine upon an advance from the east, down the Ohio
River, which was made practicable by the recent submission of the
Delaware Indians.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Illinois country in 1764 presented an anomalous
situation. St. Ange was governing, in the name of Louis XV, a
country belonging to another king. He was under orders to surrender
the place as soon as possible to its rightful owner; but the
prospect for such an event seemed remote. He was surrounded by
crowds of begging, thieving savages; and the emissaries of the
greatest of Indian chieftains, Pontiac, were constantly petitioning
for his active support against the approaching English. A considerable
portion of the French traders of the villages were secretly,
and sometimes openly, supporting the Indian cause, which
added greatly to the increasing embarrasment of the commandant.
So distressing became the situation that Neyon de Villiers, St.
Ange's predecessor, called the latter from Vincennes on the Wabash,
and left the country in disgust, taking with him to New Orleans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
sixty soldiers and eighty of the French inhabitants.
<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He had shortly
before indignantly refused to countenance the proposals of Pontiac,
and had begged the Indians to lay down their arms and make
peace with the English.
<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The news of Loftus' defeat aroused Pontiac the thought of
the possibility of meeting and repelling the advance from the east
as it had been met and repelled in the south. In spite of the
news of the defeat of his allies by Bouquet and the report that
preparations were being made by his victorious enemy to advance against
him, Pontiac determined to make a last supreme effort. By
a series of visits among the tribes dwelling in the Illinois, on
the Wabash and in the Miami country, he succeeded in arousing in
them the instinct of self-preservation, in firing the hearts of all
the faltering Indians and in winning the promise of their co-operation
in his plan of defense. He was in this temper when he met
and turned back Captain Thomas Morris in the Miami country early
in the autumn of 1764. Morris had been sent by Bradstreet from
the neighborhood of Detroit with messages to St. Ange in the Illinois
country, whence he was to proceed to New Orleans.
<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> After being
maltreated and threatened with the stake, Morris effected an
escape and made his way to Detroit.
<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It was during his interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
with Pontiac that the latter informed Morris of the repulse of
Loftus, of the journey of his emissaries to New Orleans to seek
French support, and of his determination and that of his Indian
allies to resist the English to the last.
<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>A few months later, in February, 1765, there arrived at Fort
Chartres an English officer, accompanied by a trader named Crawford.
They were probably the first Englishmen to penetrate thus
far into the former French territory since the beginning of the
war.
<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
They had been sent from Mobile by Major Farmer, the commandant
at that place, to bring about the conciliation of the Indians
in the Illinois.
<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Instead of following the Mississippi, they worked
their way northward through the great Choctaw and Chicksaw nations
to the Ohio, descended the latter to the Mississippi and
thence to the Illinois villages.
<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Although St. Ange received them cordially
<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
and did all in his power to influence the savages to receive the English,
<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
the mission of Ross was a failure. The Indians
had nothing but expressions of hatred and defiance for the English;
even the Missouri and Osages from beyond the Mississippi had fallen
under the influence of Pontiac.
<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Ross and his companion remained
with St. Ange nearly two months; but about the middle of April
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
they were obliged to go down the river to New Orleans.
<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>During the winter of 1764-1765 preparations were made to send
a detachment of troops down the Ohio from Fort Pitt to relieve
Fort Chartres. To pave the way for the troops Gage dispatched two
agents in advance. He selected George Croghan, Sir William Johnson's
deputy, for the delicate and dangerous task of going among
the Indians of that country to assure them of the peaceful attitude
of the English, to promise them better facilities for trade
and to accompany the promise with substantial presents.
<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The second
agent was Lieutenant Fraser,
<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
whose mission was to carry letters
to the French commandant and a proclamation for the inhabitants.
<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
January 24, 1765, Fraser and Croghan set out from Carlisle,
Pennsylvania,
<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
followed a few days later by a large convoy of presents.
<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
During the journey, the convoy was attacked by a band of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Pennsylvania borderers,
<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
and a large part of the goods destined
for the Indians were destroyed,
<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
together with some valuable stores
which certain Philadelphia merchants were forwarding to Fort Pitt
for the purpose of opening up the trade as early as possible.
<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Croghan therefore found it necessary to tarry at Fort Pitt to replenish
his stores and to await the opening of spring.
<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> But another
matter intervened which forced him to postpone his departure for
more than two months. A temporary defection had arisen among the
Shawnee and Delaware Indians.
<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
They had failed to fulfil some of
the obligations imposed upon them by Bouquet in the previous summer,
and there was some fear lest they would not permit Croghan to
pass through their country. His influence was such, however, that,
in an assembly of the tribes at Fort Pitt, he not only received
their consent to a safe passage, but some of their number volunteered
to accompany him.
<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Lieutenant Fraser, Croghan's companion, decided to
proceed alone, inasmuch as Gage's instructions to him were to be
at the Illinois early in April.
<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
On March 23 he departed, accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
by two or three whites and a couple of Indians,
<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and reached
the Illinois posts in the latter part of April, shortly after the
departure of Lieutenant Ross and his party. Here Fraser found
many of the Indians in destitution and some inclined for peace.
<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Nevertheless, instigated by the traders and encouraged by their
secret supplies, the savages as a whole would not listen to Fraser;
they threatened his life, and threw him into prison, and he was finally
saved by the intervention of Pontiac himself.
<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Fraser felt
himself to be in a dangerous situation; unable to hear from Croghan,
whom he was expecting every day, and daily insulted and maltreated
by the drunken savages, he took advantage of his discretionary orders
and descended the Mississippi to New Orleans.
<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Although the
French traders continued to supply the Indians with arms and ammunition,
and buoy up their spirits by stories of aid from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
king of France, Pontiac himself was being rapidly disillusioned.
He had given Fraser the assurance that if the Indians on the Ohio
had made a permanent peace, he would do likewise.
<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> St. Ange continued
to refuse the expected help,
<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
and when the news came of the
failure of the mission to New Orleans and of the transfer of Louisiana
to Spain, the ruin of the Indian cause was complete.</p>

<p>Having adjusted affairs with the Indians at Fort Pitt, Croghan
set out from there on May 15th with two boats, accompanied by several
white companions and a party of Shawnee Indians.
<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In compliance
with messages from Croghan, representatives of numerous tribes
along the route met him at the mouth of the Scioto and delivered
up a number of French traders who were compelled to take an oath
of allegiance to the English crown, or pass to the west of the
Mississippi.
<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
The only other incident of importance on this voyage
was the attack of the Kickapous and Mascoutin Indians near the
mouth of the Wabash on June 8th,
<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
which contributed greatly to the
success of the mission. After the attack in which two whites and
several Shawnees were killed, the assailants expressed their profound
sorrow, declaring that they thought the party to be a band
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of Charokees with whom they were at enmity.
<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Nevertheless, they
plundered the stores and carried Croghan and the remainder of the
party to Vincennes, a small French town on the Wabash. Croghan
was now separated temporarily from his companions and carried to
Fort Ouiatanon, about 210 miles north of Vincennes. The political
blunder of the Kickapous in firing upon the convoy now became apparent;
<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
they were censured on all sides for having attacked their
friends the Shawnees, since the latter might thus be turned into
deadly enemies.
<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
During the first week of July deputations from all
the surrounding tribes visited Croghan, assuring him of their desire
for peace and of their willingness to escort him to the Illinois
where Pontiac was residing.
<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> July 11th, Maisonville, whom
Fraser had a few weeks before left at Fort Chartres, arrived at
Ouiatanon with messages from St. Ange requesting Croghan to come
to Fort Chartres to arrange affairs in that region.
<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> A few days
later Croghan set out for the Illinois, attended by a large concourse
of savages; but he had advanced only a short distance when
he met Pontiac himself who was on the road to Ouiatanon. They all
returned to the fort where, at a great council, Pontiac signified
his willingness to make a lasting peace and promised to offer no
further resistance to the approach of the English troops.
<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
was now no need to go to Fort Chartres; instead Croghan turned his
steps toward Detroit, where another important Indian conference
was held in which a general peace was made with all the western
Indians.
<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after effecting an accomodation with Pontiac at
Ouiatanon, Croghan sent an account of the success of his negotiations
to Fort Pitt.
<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Here Captain Stirling with a detachment of
about one hundred men of the 42d or Black Watch regiment, had been
holding himself in readiness for some time, waiting for a favorable
report before moving to the relief of Fort Chartres. Although
the 34th regiment under Major Farmer was supposed to be making its
way up the Mississippi to relieve the French garrison in Illinois,
General Gage would not depend upon its slow and uncertain movements.
<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Upon receipt of the news, on the 24th of August, Stirling
left Fort Pitt
<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and began the long and tedious journey. Owing to
the season of the year the navigation of the Ohio was very difficult,
forty-seven days being required to complete the journey.
<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
The voyage, on the whole, was without incident until about forty
miles below the Wabash River. Here Stirling's force encountered
two boats loaded with goods, in charge of a French trader, who was
accompanied by some thirty Indians and a chief of the Shawnees,

who had remained in the French interest.
<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
On account of the allegations
of a certain Indian that his party had planned to fire on the
English before they were aware of the latters' strength, Stirling
became apprehensive lest the attitude of the Indians had changed
since Croghan's visit. He therefore sent Lieutenant Rumsey, with
a small party by land from Fort Massac to Fort Chartres, in order
to ascertain the exact situation and to apprise St. Ange of his
approach.
<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Rumsey and his guides, however, lost their way and did
not reach the villages until after the arrival of the troops.
<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Sterling arrived on the 9th of October; and it is said that the
Indians and French were unaware of his approach until he was within
a few miles of the village, and that the Indians upon learning
of the weakness of the English force, assumed a most insolent and
threatening attitude.
<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
On the following day St. Ange and the
French garrison were formally relieved,
<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
and with this event, the

<p class="ac">STATUS OF THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY IN THE EMPIRE.</p>


<p>Before entering upon the more detailed study of events in the
Illinois country during the period of the British occupation, it
is necessary to take into consideration certain general aspects of
the subject which will enable us to understand more clearly the
bearing of those events. The relation of that country to the empire
and the view held by British statesmen of the time relative
to its status are problems which naturally arise and demand solution.
What was the nature of the government imposed upon the
French in Illinois after its occupation? Is the hitherto prevailing
opinion that the British government placed the inhabitants of
those villages under a military government any longer tenable?
Was the government de jure or de facto?</p>

<p>The treatment received by the settlements in the Northwest
and West in general was fundamentally different in nature from
that accorded other portions of the new empire. By the terms of
the Proclamation of 1763,
<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
civil governments were created for the
provinces of Quebec, East Florida, West Florida, and Grenada,
while all the western territory outside the prescribed limits of
those colonies, including a large portion of southern Canada of
today, was reserved as a vast hunting ground for the Indian nations.
No mention whatsoever is made in the Proclamation concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the settled portions of the West and since it is, therefore,
impossible to ascertain in this document their governmental status,
we will examine the official correspondence of the ministry which
immediately proceeded the issuance of the Proclamation to find, if
possible, what the directors of the British colonial policy had in
mind.</p>

<p>When the question of the Proclamation was under discussion
by the Ministry in the summer of 1763, two opposing views with reference
to the West were for a time apparent in the ministry. It
appears to have been the policy of Lord Egremont, at that time
Secretary for the Southern Department, which included the management
of the colonies, to place the unorganized territory within
the jurisdiction of some one of the colonies possessing a settled
government, preferably Canada.
<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
It was at least his aim to give
to the Indian country sufficient civil supervision so that criminals
and fugitives from justice from the colonies might be taken.
That he did not intend to extend civil government to the villages
or any of the French inhabitants of the West seems clear: his only
reference is to the "Indian country" and to "criminals" and "fugitives
from justice."</p>

<p>Lord Shelburne, President of the Board of Trade and a member
of the Grenville ministry, and his colleagues were of the opinion
that the annexation of the West to Canada might lend color to the
idea that England's title to the West came from the French cession,
when in fact her claim was derived from other sources; that the
inhabitants of the province to which it might be annexed would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
have too great an advantage in the Indian trade; and finally that
such an immense province could not be properly governed without a
large number of troops and the governor would thus virtually become
a commander-in-chief.
<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Shelburne then announced his plan of
giving to the commanding general of the British army in America
jurisdiction over the West for the purpose of protecting the Indians
and the fur trade.
<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Lord Halifax, who succeeded to Egermont's
position at the latter's death in August, 1763, fell in with Shelburne's
views. But the commission to the commanding general does
not appear to have been issued; for Hillsborough, who succeeded
Shelburne as President of the Board of Trade in the autumn of 1763,
favored a different policy. There is nothing, however, to indicate
that Shelburne and his advisers had any thought of the government
of the French colonies. There is no hint in any of this correspondence
that the ministry had any idea of the existence of the several
thousand French inhabitants of the West.
<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>There remain one or two documents in which we might expect to
find some reference to the government of the French settlers. The
authors of that part of the Proclamation of 1763 which provided for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the reservation of the Indian lands and the regulation of the
trade,
<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
had in contemplation the formation of an elaborate plan
comprehending the management of both in the whole of British
North America.
<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
It was left to Hillsborough, Shelburne's successor
as President of the Board of Trade, to direct the formulation
of the plan, which was finished in 1764. The details of this program
will be taken up in a later chapter,
<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and it will therefore
suffice to note the presence or absence of any provisions for the
French. The chief object of the plan seems to have been to bring
about a centralization in the regulation of the trade and the management
of the Indians, and in no place is there any intimation
that its provisions have any application to the government of the
French residing at the various posts.
<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Turning to another source we find a document addressed directly
to the inhabitants of the Illinois country, dated in New York,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
December 30, 1764 and signed by General Thomas Gage.
<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Mention has
already been made in another connection of the unsuccessful mission
of Lieutenant Fraser to Illinois in the spring of 1765, when
he carried this proclamation to the inhabitants. But its contents
were not announced until the entry of Captain Sterling in October
of that year. This proclamation related solely to guarantees by
the British government of the right of the inhabitants under the
treaty of Paris: freedom of religion, the liberty of removing from
or remaining within English territory and the requirements as to
taking the oath of allegiance made up its contents. As to whether
the inhabitants were to enjoy a civil government or be ruled by
the army there is no intimation.</p>

<p>Laying aside the barren papers of 1763-1765 and giving attention
to the documentary material after those dates proves much
more productive. We are thereby enabled to arrive at some pretty
definite conclusions. Fortunately there were a few men in authority
during that period who had some interest in the interior settlements,
and who, from their official positions realized the difficulties
of the problem. Such men have left expressions of opinion
and stray bits of information which leave us in little doubt
as to the governmental status of the Illinois country. General
Thomas Gage, Sir William Johnson, and Lord Hillsborough are perhaps
the most representative examples. Gage, who was commander-in-chief
of the American army throughout this period, with headquarters
in New York City, was in direct communication both with his
subordinates in Illinois and the home authorities. He was in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
position to know, in general, the state of affairs in the West as
well as to keep in touch with ministerial opinion. Sir William
Johnson, by virtue of his office as Superintendent of Indian affairs
for the northern district, was in a peculiarly strategic position
to acquire information. His Indian agents were stationed
at all the western posts and he was in constant correspondence
with the Board of Trade relative to Indian and trade conditions.
From the ministry itself the correspondence of Lord Hillsborough
best reflects the prevailing opinion of the government. He was
one of the few governmental authorities who took any considerable
interest in the western problem and information coming from him
must, therefore, have some weight.</p>

<p>That the British commandant of the fort in the Illinois country
had no commission to govern the inhabitants, except perhaps
that power, which, in the absence of all other authority, naturally
devolves upon the military officer, seems amply clear from a recommendation
transmitted by General Gage to his superior shortly
after the occupation of Fort de Chartres. "If I may presume to
give my opinion further on this matter, I would humbly propose
that a Military Governor should be appointed for the Ilinois (sic)
as soon as possible. The distance of that Country from any of the
Provinces being about 1400 Miles, making its Dependance upon any
of them impractical, and for its Vicinity to the French Settlements,
no other than a Military Government would answer our purpose."
<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
In the following year he took a similar point of view in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
communication to his co-laborer in America: "I am quite sensible
of the irregular behavior of the Traders and have intimated to
his Majesty's Secretary of State what I told the Board of Trade
four or five years ago: That they must be restrained by Law, and a
Judicial Power invested in the officer Commanding at the Posts to
see such Law put in force. And without this, Regulations may be
made, but they will never be observed."
<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>With the condition of comparative anarchy in the Illinois
country during this period and indeed at all the western posts
and throughout the Indian country the authorities seemed unable to
combat successfully. Had all the regulations outlined in the plan
for the management of Indian affairs,
<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> been put into operation the
Indian department would have been able to cope more successfully
with that phase of the situation. But neither military nor Indian
departments had legal authority to take any action whatsoever.
As Johnson, in speaking of his inability to handle the situation
for lack of sufficient power, declared in 1767 that "the authority
of commissaries is nothing, and both the Commanding Officers of
Garrisons and they, are liable to a civil prosecution for detaining
a Trader on any pretence."
<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Probably more emphatic still the
commanding general four years later in writing of the disturbances,
said: "And I perceive there has been wanting judicial powers to
try and determine. There has been no way to bring Controversys &amp;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Disputes properly to a determination or delinquenents to punishment."
<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>There is probably some justification for the current belief
that the government placed the inhabitants under a military rule,
inasmuch as the actual government proved in the last analysis to
be military. But that the British ministry consciously attached the
interior settlements to the military department is far from the
truth. Such a system was probably contemplated by no one, particularly
between the years 1763 and 1765 when the re-organization of
the new acquisitions was under discussion. The greater part of
the new territory was the seat of the fur trade and the desire for
the development of that industry controlled in the main the policy
of the ministry relative to the disposition of the peltry districts
and the interests of the settlements were completely ignored. Secretary
Hillsborough, who helped formulate the western policy in
1763 and 1764 doubtless gave the most adequate explanation when
in 1769, he wrote: "With regard to the Posts in the interior Country
considered in another view in which several of your letters
have placed them; I mean as to the settlements formed under their
protection, which, not being included within the jurisdiction of
any other Colony are exposed to many Difficulties &amp; Disadvantages
from the Want of some Form of Government necessary to Civil Society,
it is very evident that, if the case of these Settlements had been
well known or understood at the time of forming the conquered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Lands into Colonies, some provision would have been made for them,
&amp; they would have been erected into distinct Governments or made
dependent upon those Colonies of which they were either the offspring,
or with which they did by circumstances and situation,
stand connected. I shall not fail, therefore, to give this matter
the fullest consideration when the business of the Illinois Country
is taken up."
<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>That the occupation of Fort Chartres became anything more
than temporary was due to the necessity of being prepared to crush
a possible uprising of the savages and to repel the constant invasion
of the French and Spanish traders
<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
from beyond the Mississippi,
whose influence over the Indians, it was feared, would be detrimental
to the peace of the empire. In its policy of retrenchment
owing to the trouble with the colonies, the government at various
times contemplated the withdrawal of the troops, but each
time the detachment was allowed to remain the sole reason given
was to guard that portion of the empire against the French and
Indians.</p>

<p>In the course of this inquiry relative to the legal status of
Illinois no mention has been made of the extension or non-extension
of English law and custum to the West after its cession. This is
one of the more important general aspects of the western problem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and deserves some attention inasmuch as it may throw some light on
the legal position of the settlements. During the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, the great era of English colonization, the
necessity of fixing definitely the legal status of the colonies
called forth a series of judicial opinions and legal commentaries;
it is to these we have to look to determine the theory held regarding
the application of English law to the colonies and particularly
to conquered provinces. In general it may be said that Blackstone
represents the usual view taken by jurists during these two
centuries. In his commentaries published in 1765 he declared that
"in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their
own, the king may indeed alter and change those laws, but till he
actually does change them, the ancient laws of the country remain.
<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>"
This opinion is supported by the authority of Lord Mansfield in his
decision in the case of Campbell vs Hall,
<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> rendered in 1774, which
involved the status of the island of Granada, a conquered province.
He laid down in this decision the general principle that the "laws
of a conquered country continue in force until they are altered by
the conquerer. The justice and antiquity of this maxim are incontrovertible:——"
<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The Proclamation of 1763 which had definitely extended the
laws of England to the new provinces,
<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
made no such provisions for
the West, nor did the crown ever take such action. We may, therefore,
lay down the general principle that the British Government
was obliged to govern her new subjects in this region according to
the laws and customs hitherto prevailing among them; any other
course would manifestly be illegal. The commanding general of the
army in America and his subordinates, who were embarrassed by the
presence of this French settlement for which no provision had been
made by the ministry, and who found it necessary to assume the
obligation of enforcing some sort of order in that country, had no
power to displace any of the laws and customs of the French inhabitants.
It will be pointed out in succeeding chapters that
this general principle, while adhered to in many respects, was not
uniformly carried out.</p>

<p>It is apparent from the foregoing considerations that the government
of the Illinois people was de facto in nature. It had no
legal foundations. Every action of the military department was
based on expediency; although this course was in general acquiesced
in by the home authorities, all the officials concerned were
aware that such a status could not continue indefinitely. But it
did continue for about a decade, during which time the inhabitants
were at the mercy of some six or seven different military commandants.
In 1774, however, Parliament passed the Quebec Act, which
provided, among other things, for the union of all the western
country north of the Ohio River, and which but for the cataclysm
of the American revolution meant civil government for the whole
region.</p>

<p class="ac">TRADE CONDITIONS IN ILLINOIS, 1765-1775.</p>


<p>The peltry trade had been one of the elements which had accentuated,
throughout the eighteenth century, the difficulties between
France and England in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. It
was the chief support of the French government in Canada and now
that the English were in undisputed possession of the great peltry
districts it became apparent that the management of the trade deserved
most serious consideration. It was becoming of increasing
importance to the manufacturing monopoly of the mother country, and
therefore, in the minds of English statesmen, deserved far more
attention than did the few thousand French colonists scattered
throughout the West. The desire to increase this branch of commerce
dictated in a large measure those clauses in the Proclamation
of 1763 which forbade the formation of settlements or the
purchase of lands within the Indian reservation, but at the same
time declared that the trade with the Indians should be free and
open to all English subjects alike. Again, the plan proposed in
1764 related solely to the management of the Indians and to the
regulation of the trade with a view to making the English monopoly
of intrinsic value to the empire. Even towards the close of the
period under consideration there is little or no change of policy
so far as official utterances are concerned. In 1772 in a report
to the crown, the Lords of Trade made the following declaration:
"The great object of colonization upon the continent of North America
has been to improve and extend the commerce and manufactures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of this kingdom. It does appear to us that the extension of
the fur trade depends entirely upon the Indians being undisturbed
in the possession of their hunting grounds, and that all colonization
does in its nature and must in its consequence operate to the
prejudice of that branch of commerce. Let the savages enjoy their
deserts in quiet. Were they driven from their forests the peltry
trade would decrease."
<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Under the French regime the western Indians and their trade
had been managed with greater success than had the tribes living
under English influence. The success of France was due largely to
her policy of centralization combined of course with the genial
character of the French fur trader and the influence of the missionary.
The English, on the contrary, had managed their relations
with the Indians through the agency of the different colonies,
without a semblance of union or co-operation: each colony competed
for the lion's share of the trade, a policy which resulted disastrously
to the peace of the empire.</p>

<p>In 1755 the English government under the influence of Halifax,
president of the Board of Trade, took over the political control
of the Indians, and superintendents were appointed by the crown to
reside among the different nations.
<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
A little later in 1761 the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
purchase of Indian lands was taken out of the hands of the colonies
and placed under the control of the home government.
<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> No further
change is to be noted until after the issue of the war was known,
when the whole question was taken under consideration. The most
important step yet taken respecting the Indian and his concomitant,
the fur trade, appeared in the Proclamation of 1763, issued in
October following the treaty of cession. Some of its provisions
for the West have already been noted. In addition to reserving
for the present the unorganized territory between the Alleghany
mountains and the Mississippi River for the use of the Indians,
the government guaranteed the Indians in the possession of those
lands by announcing in the Proclamation that no Governor or Commander-in-chief
would be allowed to make land grants within their
territory, and further all land purchases and the formation of settlements
by private individuals without royal consent were prohibited.
Trade within this reservation was made, however, free to all
who should obtain a license from the Governor or Commander-in-chief
of the colony in which they resided.
<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The policy was now for the central government to take the
Indian trade under its management; and in the course of the year
following the issuance of the Proclamation an elaborate plan was
outlined by Hillsborough
<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
comprehending the political and commercial
relations with all the Indian territory.</p>

<p>According to the proposed scheme
<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
British North America was
to be divided, for the purpose of Indian management, into two districts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
a northern and a southern, each under the control of a
general superintendent or agent appointed by the crown: the Ohio
River being designated as the approximate line of division. In
the northern district, with which we are here concerned, the regulation
of such Indian affairs as treaties, land purchases, questions
of peace and war, and trade relations were to be given into
the hands of the superintendent who was to be entirely free from
outside interference: without his consent no civil or military officer
could interfere with the trade or other affairs of any of
the Indian tribes. Three deputies were to be appointed to assist
the superintendent and at each post a commissary, an interpreter,
and a smith were to reside, acting under the immediate direction
of the superintendent and responsible only to him for their conduct.
For the administration of justice between traders and Indians
and between traders themselves, the commissary at each post
was to be empowered to act as justice of the peace in all civil
and criminal cases. In civil cases involving sums not exceeding
ten pounds an appeal might be taken to the superintendent. The
Indian trade was to be under the direct supervision of the general
superintendent. Traders who desired to go among the Indians to
ply their trade could do so by obtaining a license from the province
from which they came. The region into which the trader intended
to go was to be clearly defined in the license and each had
to give bond for the observance of the laws regulating the trade.
The superintendent, together with the commissary at the post and
a representative of the Indians were to fix the value of all goods
and traders were forbidden to charge more than the price fixed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
for the still better regulation of the trade, it was to be centered
about the regularly fortified and garrisoned forts. Regulations
for the sale of land were also proposed; outside the limits of the
colonies no individual or company could legally purchase land from
the Indians unless at a general meeting of the tribe presided over
by the superintendent.</p>

<p>The plan thus outlined by the ministry was never legally carried
into effect, although the superintendents used the outline as
a guide in their dealings with the Indians. The original intention
had been to levy a tax on the Indian trade to defray the expense
of putting the scheme into operation, but it was found that
the budget was already too greatly burdened; and the Stamp Act disturbance
which soon followed illustrated the possible inexpediency
of imposing such a duty.
<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing considerations serve to indicate the importance
the ministry attached to the Indian trade in general. But what of
the trade in the Illinois country? This region had been one of
the great centers of the Indian trade under the French regime; and,
in addition, the French inhabitants had been one of the main supports
of New Orleans since its foundation early in the century.
The commercial connection between the Illinois villages and New
Orleans had never been broken, and at the time of the occupation
of Illinois in 1765 French fur traders and merchants still plied
their traffic up and down the Mississippi River. Now that the
title to this trade center passed to England it was expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
that the volume of trade would be turned eastward from its southerly
route. The necessity for this was patent if any solid benefits
were to accrue to the empire from the cession.

<a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The home and colonial authorities early saw the importance of
the redirection of the trade. They hoped and expected that a
trade would be opened with the Indians in and about the Illinois
country immediately after the active occupation by the English
troops.
<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
A large number of individual traders were early aware of
this and representatives of some of the large trading corporations
of the East were also preparing to take advantage of the early opening
of the trade. In 1765 Fort Pitt became the great rendezvous
for this element, and when the army reached Fort Chartres in October,
1765, it was followed as soon as the season of the year would
permit, by the traders with their cargoes to exchange for the Indians'
furs. Among the more important figures was George Morgan,
<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
a member of the firm of Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan of Philadelphia,
<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
and the firm's personal representative at the Illinois,
where he first appeared early in 1766,
<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
remaining there the greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
part of the next five years.
<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Other representatives of this company
left Fort Pitt in March of the same year with a large cargo of
goods, which reached Fort Chartres during the summer.
<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Firms such
as Franks and Company of Philadelphia and London and Bently and
Company of Manchac also traded extensively in the Illinois during
the following years: all the larger British companies becoming rivals
for that portion of the Indian trade which the English were
able to command.</p>

<p>Other and perhaps greater sources of profit to the English
merchants lay in the privilege of furnishing the garrison with provisions
<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
and the Indian department with goods for Indian presents.
<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Although the houses of Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan, and Franks
and Company were usually competitors for the former privileges, the
latter company generally had the monopoly.
<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> On the other hand,
Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan derived their greatest profits from
the sale of enormous quantities of goods to the government through
the Indian department for distribution among the Indians accustomed
to assemble at the Illinois.
<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
But whether all these houses received
profits commensurate with the risks undertaken is problematical.
<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
In the Indian trade, in which all the merchants were interested,
they not only had to compete with each other and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
independent English traders, but with the French and Spanish who
had not ceased to ply their trade among their old friends the Indians.
This continuance of foreign traders in British territory
was probably the most serious problem in the trade situation. Not
only did it affect English traders but the interests of the empire
itself were seriously threatened by the presence within its limits
of unlicensed foreign traders.</p>

<p>It is therefore evident that the close of hostilities between
France and England in 1763 and the formal transfer of Canada and
the West to Great Britain by no means closed the intense rivalry
between the fur trading elements of the two nations for predominance
in the western trade: it rather accentuated it. As has already
been suggested, France, until cession of the West, had
naturally possessed the sphere of influence among the savages of
the Mississippi Valley and Canada, and consequently the monopoly
of the fur trade accrued to her subjects. In the upper Ohio river
region and among the tribes bordering on or living within the limits
of the English colonies, the British, during the first half of
the eighteenth century, were either strong rivals of the French or
were completely dominant. And it was generally expected that after
the cession of the West the British would inherit the influence
of the French among the Indians and succeed to the monopoly of the
fur trade just as Great Britain had succeeded to the sovereignty
of the territory itself. But the Conspiracy of Pontiac, due in
large part to the machinations of the French traders, postponed
for a considerable period the entry of the British traders, during
which time the French became more strongly entrenched than ever in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the affections of the savages.</p>

<p>The character of the French fur traders has already been noted.
Their methods had from the beginning been different from
those pursued by their neighbors and rivals: they lived among the
Indians, affected their manners, treated them kindly and respectfully,
and supplied all their wants, while the missionary, the connecting
link between the two races, was ever present. This association
of religion was one of the causes of the success of the
French in gaining such a permanent foothold in the affections of
the Indians, but was entirely absent in the British relation with
that race. The English traders were in general unscrupulous
<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> in
their dealings with the savages and deficient of that tact which
enabled Frenchmen to overcome the natural prejudice of the Indian
and acquire an interest with him which would be difficult to sever.
In that section of the Indian country where the influence of Great
Britain was such that her traders could go among the Indians, there
was always considerable dissatisfaction on account of the methods
employed by the large number of independent and irresponsible traders.
Many carried large quantities of rum, some dealing in nothing
else.
<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
English traders frequently attended public meetings of
Indians, gave them liquor during the time for business and defrauded
them of their furs.
<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
This abuse was one of the great causes
of complaint against British traders.
<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Indeed, wherever they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
participated in the trade, its condition was deplorable. Many of
the independent traders had little or no credit so that the legitimate
merchants suffered as well as the Indians.
<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> They adopted
various expedients to draw trade from each other, one of which was
to sell articles below first cost, thus ruining a large number of
traders.
<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Fabrications dangerous to the public were frequently
created to explain the price and condition of goods.
<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> But probably
more injurious still to imperial interests, was the fact that whole
cargoes of goods were sometimes sold by English firms to French
traders thus enabling the latter to engross a great part of the
trade,
<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
depriving the empire of the benefit of the revenue accruing
from the importation of furs into England. This practice was
probably followed to a greater degree in the farther West, where
the French continued to have a monopoly in the trade.</p>

<p>It had been expected that the Illinois villages would be the
center of trade for the English side of the upper Mississippi Valley
just as it had been one of the centers during the French regime.
<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
But, except for the few tribes of Illinois Indians in the
immediate vicinity, very few savages found their way to these posts
for trading purposes. English traders, on the other hand, did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
trust themselves far beyond this narrow circle.
<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> But their French
and Spanish rivals from Louisiana, many of whom formally lived in
the Illinois, carried on a trade in all directions, both by land
and by water.
<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
They ascended the Ohio, Wabash, and Illinois rivers
<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
and crossed the Mississippi River above the Illinois River, plying
their traffic among the tribes in the region of the Wisconsin and
Fox rivers.
<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
This was probably the most productive area in the
Mississippi Valley in the supply of fur bearing animals. The
Mississippi River from its junction with the Illinois northward
was also considered especially good for the peltry business: the
otter, beaver, wolf, cervine, and marten were to be found in abundance.
<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
But the British traders dared not venture into that quarter.
The loss of this trade, however, can scarcely be attributed
to their misconduct, for the French had never allowed it to pass
from their own hands. The latter continued to intrigue with the
Indians throughout the greater part of this period just as they
had prior to 1765. As we have seen they pointed out to the savages
how they would suffer from the policy of economy practiced
by the British government.
<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Thus by giving presents and circulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
stories and misrepresentations the French subjects of Spain
attempted to checkmate every move of the English.
<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The Indians
were constantly reminded of the bad designs on the part of the
English, and were encouraged with unauthorized promises of aid in
case they took up the hatchet in defense of their hunting grounds.
<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>This state of affairs continued throughout the greater part
of the period, although it was probably modified to some extent
after 1770, for in that year O'Reilly, the Spanish governor of
Louisiana, issued an order to all the commandants in that colony
to prohibit the inhabitants crossing the river in the pursuit of
trade and whenever any excesses were committed satisfaction was to
be given the English commandant according to the laws of nations.
<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>During the first years of the British occupation there was
considerable friction in the contact between the two alien peoples
in the Illinois villages. In spite of the fact that the French
who remained became subjects of Great Britain there was for several
years sharp competition between the English and French residents
in the vicinity of the villages.
<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
The latter were on terms of
friendship with the savages and could go into any part of the country
without difficulty and those Indians who came to Fort Chartres
to trade generally preferred to deal with their trusted friends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
The French often carried the packs of furs thus obtained across
the river to St. Louis or transported them directly to the New
Orleans market. Although the British merchants were occasionally
to pool their interests with French residents, such cases were
exceptional prior to 1770. In that year, however, General Gage
informed the home government that "the competition between his
Majestys' old and new Subjects is greatly abated &amp; must by degrees
subside, for if carried to extremes it would be very prejudicial
to both."
<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>We have seen in the foregoing study how the British traders
were handicapped in the prosecution of the trade by their French
rivals. Naturally the large quantities of furs and skins obtained
by such contraband traders as well as by the French residents of
Illinois were taken directly to New Orleans and there embarked for
the ports of France and Spain. These foreign interlopers, however,
only followed the course they had long been accustomed to
take. On the other hand it was expected by the government that
the traders who carried English manufactured goods down the Ohio
River would return by the same route with their cargoes of peltry
for the purpose of transporting them to England. In this the aim
of the ministry miscarried. English traders and merchants followed
the line of least resistance: the route down the Mississippi to
New Orleans was easier and quicker than up the Ohio and across the
country to the sea-coast.
<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
Moreover, the New Orleans market was attractive,
for peltries sold at a higher price there than in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
British market.
<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
The tendency of the English traders and merchants
to follow this course was discovered soon after the occupation.
<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
In a communication to Secretary Shelburne in 1766 Gage informed
the government that "it is reported that the Traders in West Florida
carry most of their Skins to New Orleans, where they sell them
at as good a price as is given in London. As I had before some
Intelligence of this, the Officer commanding at Fort Pitt had Orders
to watch the Traders from Pensilvania (sic) who went down the
Ohio in the Spring to Fort Chartres; &amp; to report the quantity of
Peltry they should bring up the Ohio in the Autumn. He has just
acquainted me that the traders do not return to his Post, that
they are gone down the Mississippi with all their Furrs and Skinns
under the pretense of embarking them at New Orleans for England."
<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
A few weeks later he wrote again in a similar strain: "That Trade
will go with the stream is a maxim found to be true from all Accounts
that have been received of the Indian Trade carried on in
that vast Tract of Country which lies in the Back of the British
Colonies; and that the peltry acquired there is carried to the Sea
either by the River St. Lawrence or River Mississippi."
<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Gage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
seemed to believe that the part which went down the St. Lawrence
would be transported to England; but that the peltry passing
through New Orleans would never enter a British port.
<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> "Nothing
but prospect of a superior profit or force will turn the Channel
of Trade contrary to the above maxim."
<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems impossible to figure exactly what the loss to imperial
interests was under these conditions.
<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Furs and skins, however
being among the enumerated commodities
<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> some loss certainly
accrued to British shipping and to the government through loss of
the duty, as well as to English manufacturers. While practically
no peltries reached the Atlantic ports from the Illinois region,
enormous quantities were carried to New Orleans. The few who have
left any estimate of the amount of peltries exported to New Orleans
agree in general that from 500 to 1000 packs were shipped annually
from Illinois. According to the usual estimate 500 packs were
worth in New Orleans about 3500 pounds sterling.
<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> At New Orleans,
where the western trade finally centered, it was estimated that
peltries worth between 75,000 and 100,000 pounds sterling were
sent annually to foreign ports.
<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>It became apparent to those in a position to understand the
situation that those solid advantages which the Government had expected
would accrue in return for the expense of maintaining establishments
in the West would not be forthcoming, unless some effective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
though expensive measures be taken. The rivalry of the
French who monopolized the larger part of the trade and who naturally
followed their old road to New Orleans, and the action of
the English traders in turning the channel of their trade down the
stream effectually deprived the empire of any benefits. Conditions
grew no better as the years went by. In 1767 we find General Gage
complaining that "as for the Trade of the Ilinois, and in general
of the Mississippi, we may dispose of some manufactures there, but
whilst Skins and Furrs bear a high price at New Orleans, no Peltry
gained by our manufactures, will ever reach Great Britain, and if
our Traders do not return with the Produce of their Trade to the
Northern Provinces, by way of the Ohio or Lakes, it will not answer
to England to be at much expence about the Mississippi."
<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Not only
were the officials in America, who were in close touch with western
affairs, convinced of the impossibility of obtaining any immediate
commercial benefits from the country, but one of the leading members
of the ministry, Lord Hillsborough, Secretary for the colonies,
took a similar view, in an argument against the planting of
western colonies. "This Commerce cannot (I apprehend) be useful to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Great Britain otherwise than as it furnishes a material for her
Manufactures, but it will on the contrary be prejudicial to her in
proportion as other Countries obtain that material from us without
its coming here first; &amp; whilst New Orleans is the only Post for
Exportation of what goes down the Mississippi, no one will believe
that that town will not be the market for Peltry or that those restrictions,
which are intended to secure the exportation of that
Commodity directly to G. Britain, can have any effect under such
circumstances."
<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Though there seems to have been a unanimity of
opinion respecting the commercial inutility of the Illinois and
surrounding country under existing conditions, there were those,
however, who believed that with the adoption of certain measures
the western country could be made of intrinsic commercial value.
Whether any adequate steps could have been taken to turn the channel
of trade eastward and to exclude foreign traders is uncertain.</p>

<p>The original intention of the British government had been to
use Fort Chartres to guard the rivers in order to prevent contraband
trading;
<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
but its inefficiency was soon apparent.
<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Although
well constructed, its location was not strategic; it commanded
nothing but an island in the river.
<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
An indication to the Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of British dominion
<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
and a place of deposit for English merchants
was about the sum total of its efficiency.
<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> In order to make the
Illinois country effective as a bulwark against foreign aggression
and to keep the trade in English hands, thus insuring material advantages
to the empire, it seemed imperative to many who were familiar
with the situation to adopt measures looking toward the closure
of those natural entrances into the country, the mouths of the
Illinois and Ohio rivers.
<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
Almost all the correspondence of the
time relating to Illinois, contains references to the practicability
of erecting forts at the junctions of the Illinois and Ohio
rivers with the Mississippi; in most cases this was insisted upon
as the only measure to be adopted to make the country of value.
<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
All were further in agreement that until such plan was carried out
no benefits would arise from the possession of that territory.
Suggestion were also offered relative to the erection of a fort on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the Mississippi River above its junction with the Illinois for the
protection of that section of the country.
<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Perhaps the most novel
suggestion emanated from General Gage, who declared that in order
to gain all the advantages expected it would be necessary to amalgamate
all the little French villages lying between the Illinois
and Ohio rivers into one settlement, which would also be the centre
of the military establishment; detachments could then be sent
out to guard the rivers and prevent British merchants from descending
the stream to New Orleans and also watch for foreign interlopers.
<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>But these suggestions one and all failed to receive recognition
from the government. One of the main reasons for this non-action
may well be summed up in a statement of Hillsborough's, who
appears by 1770 to have become somewhat pessimistic regarding the
prospect of any immediate advantages from the western trade. He
declared in that year that "Forts &amp; Military Establishments at
the Mouths of the Ohio &amp; Illinois Rivers, admitting that they
would be effectual to the attainment of the objects in view, would
yet, I fear, be attended with an expence to this Kingdom greatly
disproportionate to the advantage proposed to be gained.——"
<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>The failure of the government to manage successfully the western
trade previous to 1770 was not the only reason the ministry
hesitated to do any thing further. Any measure would have meant
the expenditure of large sums of money with no absolute certainty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of an adequate return. The problem of the western trade confronted
the ministry at a most unfortunate time. Questions of graver
import were arising and demanding immediate attention. Instead
of seeking new schemes upon which to lavish money, every opportunity
was seized upon to curtail expenses. The government failed to
put into full operation the plan of 1764 because of the added financial
burden it would entail and in 1768 the management of the
Indian Trade was transferred from the crown to the colonies to
further reduce the budget. The western question had become subordinated
to that of the empire. Furs were important to the manufacturing
monopoly of Great Britain, but at this time of rising
discontent and dissatisfaction in the colonies any new projects
entailing further expense were out of the question.</p>

<p class="ac">COLONIZING SCHEMES IN THE ILLINOIS.</p>


<p>Although prior to the Seven Years War France was in nominal
possession of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, the English colonies
on the sea-board viewed that territory in a different light.
The old sea to sea charters still possessed a potential value in
the eyes of British colonists and little or no respect was accorded
the claims of France. Gradually toward the middle of the century
the more enterprising and farsighted of the colonists, who appreciated
the future value of the region, began to lay plans for
its systematic exploitation. As early as 1748, shortly after the
peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, the Ohio Company, composed of London
merchants and Virginia land speculators obtained from the crown a
grant of land south of the Ohio river. This was the precursor of
several companies formed for similar purposes. In 1754 the question
of western expansion had become of sufficient importance to
engage the attention of the Albany Congress, the plans for the
creation of western colonies were discussed by that body.
<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The
following year Samuel Hazard of Philadelphia outlined a proposition
looking toward the formation of a western colony,
<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>—probably the
first which comprehended the Illinois country.</p>

<p>The treaty of cession of 1763 gave a new impulse to the colonizing
spirit which had lain dormant during the early years of the
war. The English now believed that they were free to occupy at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
will the unsettled lands as far westward as the Mississippi River.
Early in the summer of 1763, before the British ministry had had
time to consider and determine its policy toward the new acquisitions,
there was formed an organization known as the Mississippi
Land Company,
<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
for the purpose of planting a colony in the Illinois
and Wabash regions. In this scheme some of the most prominent inhabitants
of Virginia and Maryland were interested,
<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>—indeed membership
in the organization was drawn almost entirely from those two
colonies and from London. The Company was eventually to be composed
of fifty members who were to contribute equally towards the
maintenance of an agent in England, to whom was intrusted the duty
of soliciting from the crown a grant of two million five hundred
thousand acres of land
<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
on the Mississippi and its tributaries, the
Wabash and Ohio rivers. The proposed grant was to be "laid off
within the following bounds beginning upon the East side of the
Rivers Mississippi one hundred and twenty miles above or to the
northward of the confluence of the River Ohio therewith. Thence
by a line to strike the river Wabash or St. Ireon eighty miles
above the union of Ohio and Wabash, and abutting on the main branch
of the River Cherokee or Tennessee one hundred fifty mile above
the junction of Cherokee River with Ohio and proceeding thence Westerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in a line to strike the River Mississippi seventy miles below
the union of Ohio with that River; thence upon the said River
to the beginning."
<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
The subscribers were to be free to retain their
lands twelve years or more at the pleasure of the crown without
the payment of taxes on quit rents. Within the same period also
the company was to be obliged to settle two hundred families in the
colony, unless prevented by Indians or a foreign enemy.
<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In order
to insure against any such interruption, it was hinted that the
government might establish and garrison two forts,—one at the confluence
of the Cherokee
<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
and Ohio rivers, and the other at the
mouth of the Ohio.
<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>In their petition the memorialists enumerate the advantages
they expect the empire to receive in case the land be granted,
special emphasis being laid on two points of view,—commerce and
defence. "The Increase of the people, the extension of trade and
the enlargement of the revenue are with certainty to be expected,
where the fertility of the soil, and mildness of the climate invite
emigrants (provided they can obtain Lands on easy terms) to
settle and cultivate commodities most wanted by Great Britain and
which will bear the charges of a tedious navigation, by the high
prices usually given for them,—such as Hemp, Flax, Silk, Wine,
Potash, Cochineal, Indigo, Iron, &amp;c., by which means the Mother Country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
will be supplied with many necessary materials, that are now
purchased by foreigners at a very great expense."
<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>From the point of view of both trade and defense, the company
proposed "that by conducting a trade useful to the Indians on the
borders of the Mississippi they will effectually prevent the success
of that cruel policy, which has ever directed the French in
time of peace, to prevail with the Indians their neighbors to lay
waste the frontiers of your Majestie's Colonies thereby to prevent
their increase."
<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, the establishment of a buffer colony would effectually
prevent the probable encroachments of the French from the West side
of the Mississippi, and cut off their political and commercial connection
with the Indians. They would "thereby be prevented from
instigating them to War, and the harrassing the frontier Counties
as they have constantly done of all the Colonies."
<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>The plan received its first official check in the year of its
inception, when in October, 1763, the British ministry announced
its western policy in a proclamation according to which all the
territory lying north of the Floridas and west of the Alleghanies
was reserved for the use of the Indians.
<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Thereafter the colonial
governors were forbidden to issue patents for land within this
reservation without the consent of the crown.
<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> However, the enounciation
of this policy did not deter this and similar companies
from pressing their claims upon the Board of Trade. The more far-sighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of the Americans had probably correctly interpreted the
proclamation as temporary in character and as promulgated to allay
the alarm of the savages.
<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
The Mississippi company therefore continued
to solicit the grant until 1769, when it was decided that
on account of the temper of the ministry towards America, it would
be advisable to allow the matter to rest for a time in the hope
that a change in the government would bring a corresponding change
in policy.
<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
But at no time does it appear that the promoters of the
colony received the slightest encouragement from those in authority.
<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>About the time of the Mississippi company in 1763, General
Charles Lee
<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
outlined a scheme for the establishment of two colonies,
one on the Ohio River below its junction with the Wabash,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and the other on the Illinois River.
<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
It was his plan to organize
a company and petition the crown for the necessary grants of land.
<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
A portion of the settlers were to be procured in new England, and
the remainder from among Protestants of Germany and Switzerland.
<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
In narrating the probable advantages which he thinks would be derived
from such settlements, Lee takes practically the same point
of view as the Mississippi company, adding the suggestion that a
new channel of commerce would be opened up through the Mississippi
River and the Gulf of Mexico.
<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
This proposal suffered the same fate
as its contemporary in being objected by the ministry, whose policy
of allowing no settlements in the country beyond the mountains had
been too recently adopted.
<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Thus far there seems to be no indication that the above mentioned
colonizing schemes received encouragement from any one in
close touch with the government. Apparently the authors of those
projects did not have the ear of those members of the ministry,
whose general attitude gave some ground for the belief that in the
end plans for western settlements would be adopted. The most prominent
among these was Lord Shelbourne, whose personal attitude favored
carving the West into colonies. Possibly his friendship with
Dr. Franklin influenced him in part to throw the weight of his prestige
in favor of a new plan for a colony, promoted this time by
prominent merchants and land speculators of New York, Pennsylvania,
and New Jersey. It was in 1766 that the next definite scheme appeared,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
although it is probable that there were many others, for
during those years half of England was said to have been "New Land
mad as every body there had their eyes fixt on this Country."
<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
Pamphlet literature was printed and disseminated throughout England and
America from 1763 on advocating the feasibility of settling
the new lands,
<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
which doubtless had considerable influence.
It is hardly probable that the few definite propositions of which
we have recorded were the only schemes projected during this period.
<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The plan of 1764 had its origin we may safely say as 1764.
In January of that year the Board of Trade received a communication
from one of the promoters of the plan, George Croghan, who
was then in England, asking their Lordships "whether it would not
be good policy at this time while we certainly have it in our power
to secure all the advantages we have got there by making a purchase
of the Indians inhabiting the Country along the Mississippi
from the mouth of the Ohio up to the sources of the River Illinois,
and there plant a respectable colony, in order to secure our frontiers,
and prevent the French from any attempt to rival us in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Fur trade with the Natives, by drawing the Ohio and Lake Indians
over the Mississippi which they have already attempted by the last
accounts we have from Detroit."
<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>The tentative proposition thus suggested by Croghan to the
Board was in essence the same plan that he and his associates developed
two years later. In its general outline there is no intimation
that Croghan intended at this time to include the cultivated
lands of the French inhabitants of Illinois who might leave
that country.
<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
But Sir William Johnson, his superior in the Indian
department in America and his constant associate in colonizing
enterprizes, writing to the two years subsequently, gave as his
opinion that "some of the present Inhabitants may possibly incline
to go home, and our Traders will I dare say chuse to purchase
their rights, this may be the foundation for a Valuable
Colony in that Country, —-—, this may be effected in time, &amp;
large cessions obtained of the Natives."
<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> This idea of basing the
colony in part upon the lands vacated by the French was a few
weeks later taken up and emphasized by General Gage. He declared
that there was only one way to obviate the difficulties in Illinois
on account of lack of provisions for the army as well as to form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
at the least expense a barrier against probable incursions of
foreigners from Louisiana. That method must be to "grant the lands
deserted by the French, which I presume forfeited, as well as other
Lands unsettled, using necessary Precautions to avoid Disputes
with the Indians, to the British Settlers."
<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> While Croghan, Johnson,
and Gage were thus advocating the purchase of the French
claims and some additional Indian lands with the view of forming a buffer
colony, Governor William Franklin of New Jersey and some Philadelphia
merchants, all friends of the Indian agent Croghan, were
promoting the same scheme, and on March 29th, 1766, Governor
Franklin drew up
<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> a formal sketch.
<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
"A few of us, from his (Croghan's)
encouragement, have formed a Company, to purchase of the
French, settled at the Illinois, such lands as they have a good
title to, and are inclined to dispose of. But as I thought it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
would be of little avail to buy lands in the Country, unless a
Company were established there, I have drawn some proposals for
that purpose, which are much approved of by Col. Croghan and the
other gentlemen concerned in Philadelphia, and are sent by them to
Sir William Johnson for his sentiments, and when we receive them,
the whole will be forwarded to you. It is proposed that the Company
shall consist of twelve, now in America, and if you like the
proposals, you will be at liberty to add Yourself, &amp; such other
gentlemen of character &amp; fortune in England, as you may think will
be most likely to promote the undertaking."
<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Franklin's letter to his father explains very clearly the
steps in the development of the plan up to that time. It is necessary,
however, to examine other sources in order to ascertain
details concerning the proposition. The Articles of Agreement as
outlined by Governor Franklin contains the tentative proposal that
application be made to the crown for a grant in the Illinois
country of 1,200,000 acres or "more if to be procured."
<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Provision
was also made in the original draft for ten equal shareholders,
the stipulation to be subject to change in case others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
desired to enter the company.
<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
The original draft was sent to Sir
William Johnson who was requested to consider the proposals and
make any alterations he saw fit.
<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
The articles were then to be returned
to Governor Franklin, with Johnson's recommendations to the
ministry.
<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
Through Franklin the papers were to be forwarded to Dr.
Franklin in London, to whom was intrusted the task of negotiating
with the ministry.
<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>In his recommendations Johnson urged upon the ministry the
adoption of the proposals and in addition offered a number of suggestions
among which the following are of interest.
<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> 1. The crown
should purchase from the Indians all their right to the territory
in the Illinois country. 2. A civil government should be established.
3. The proposed land grants should be laid out in townships
according to the practice in New England. 4. Provincial officers
and soldiers who served in the French war should receive grants.
5. The mines and minerals should belong to the owners of the land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in which they may be found, except royal mines, from which the
crown might receive a fifth. 6. In every township 500 acres should
be reserved for the maintenance of a clergyman of the Established
Church of England. 7. Finally the lands of the colony were suggested
as follows:—From the mouth of the Ouisconsin (or Wisconsin)
River down the Mississippi agreeable to Treaty, to the Forks, or
Mouth of the Ohio. Then up the same River Ohio to the River Wabash,
thence up the same River Wabash to the Portage at the Head thereof.
Then by the said Portage to the River Miamis and down the said
River Miamis to Lake Erie. Thence along the several Courses of the
said Lake to Riviere al Ours (or Bear River) and up the said River
to the Head thereof, and from thence in a straight Line, or by the
Portage of St. Josephs River &amp; down the same River to Lake Michigan
then along the several Courses of the said Lake on the South and
West Side thereof to the point of Bay Puans, and along the several
Courses on the East Side of the said Bay to the Mouth of Foxes River,
thence up to the Head thereof and from thence by a Portage to the
Head of Ouisconsin River, and down the same to the Place of Beginning.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin exerted every effort to advance the project
in England, but with little success. Lord Shelburne, who was at
this time Secretary of State for the southern department, was also
ready and anxious to see the new colony established, and he was
able to influence the ministry to take a favorable view. Others
in authority, however, and particularly members of the Board of
Trade, were opposed to the proposition.
<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> In 1768, the Board,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
under the presidency of Hillsborough, reported adversely and the
question of the Illinois colony was dropped. Attention of land
speculators was now called to the new Vandalia colony in the upper
Ohio region.</p>

</div>

<p class="ac">EVENTS IN THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY, 1765-1768.</p>


<p>In the foregoing chapters an attempt has been made to point
out certain general aspects relating to the West and to the Illinois
country, with special reference to the governmental status of
the old French settlements after the conquest, the extension of
the English law to the conquered territory, some of the problems
of the Indian and trade relations, and finally attention has been
called to some of the projects for the colonization of the Illinois
country after 1763. What were the actual events taking place
in the Illinois after the occupation has always been problematical.
Previous writers have almost without exception dismissed with a
sentence the first two or three years of the period. Indeed the
whole thirteen years of British administration have generally been
crowded into two or three paragraphs. Although the available historical
material relating to the material to the period in general
has recently been considerably augmented, there yet remain gaps
which must be bridged before a complete history of the colony under
the British can be written.</p>

<p>Among the first duties of the British commandant after taking
formal possession of Fort de Chartres in October, 1765, was to
announce to the inhabitants the contents of Gage's proclamation. It
is only from this document that we know anything of the status of
the individual inhabitants of Illinois. One of its leading features
was a clause granting to the French the right of the free exercise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of the Roman Catholic religion "in the same manner as in Canada,"
<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
which was the fulfillment on the part of the British government of
the pledge stipulated in the IVth article of the treaty of Paris,
containing the following clause: "Brittanick Majesty agrees to
grant the liberty of the Catholic religion to the inhabitants of
Canada; he will consequently give the most precise and effectual
orders, that his new Roman Catholic subjects may profess the worship
of their religion, according to the rites of the Roman Catholic
Church, as far as the laws of Great Britain permit."
<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> This provision
appertained to the whole western territory as well as to
Canada proper. Prior to the treaty of cession the Illinois and
Wabash settlements were subject to the jurisdiction of Louisiana,
while approximately the country north of the Fortieth parallel had
been within the limits of Canada. But in the treaty all the territory
lying between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi river was
described as a dependency of Canada. The government was thus commited
to religious toleration within the whole extent of the ceded
territory. This meant, however, that only the religious privileges
of the church had been secured, for the clause in the treaty, "as
far as the laws of Great Britain permit," meant that papal authority
would not be tolerated within the British empire.</p>

<p>Other clauses provided that all the inhabitants of Illinois
who had been subjects of the king of France, might if they so desired,
sell their estates and retire with their effects to Louisiana.
No restraint would be placed on their emigration, except for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
debt or on account of criminal processes.
<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
This was also a fulfillment
of the pledges made in the treaty of Paris.
<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> All the inhabitants
who desired to retain their estates and become subjects
of Great Britain were guaranteed security for their persons and
effects and liberty of trade.
<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Finally they were commanded to take
the oath of allegiance and fidelity to the crown in case they remained
on British soil.
<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>When Captain Sterling proceeded to Kaskaskia to post the
proclamation and to administer the oaths of allegiance for which he
was empowered by the commanding general, he was confronted by an
unexpected movement on the part of the inhabitants. A petition was
presented signed by the representative French of the village, asking
for a respite of nine months in order that they might settle
their affairs and decide whether they wished to remain under the
British government or withdraw from the country.
<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> At first Sterling
refused to grant the request.
<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
According to the terms of the Paris
treaty the inhabitants of the ceded territory had been given
eighteen months in which to withdraw, the time to be computed from
the date of the exchange of ratifications.
<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The limit had long
since expired, and it was therefore beyond the power of Sterling
or his superior General Gage to grant legally an extension of time.

When, however, the commandant perceived that unless some concessions
were granted, the village would be immediately depopulated, he extended
the time to the first of March, 1766, with the provisions
that a temporary oath of allegence be given,
<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and that all desiring
to leave the country should give in their names in advance.
<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
To this tentative proposition the French in Kaskaskia agreed on
condition that Sterling forward to the commanding general a petition,
in which they ask for the longer time.
<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> An officer was dispatched
to the villages of Prairie du Rocher, St. Phillipe, and
Cahokia where similar arrangements were made.
<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>The machinery of civil government in operation under the
French regime had become badly deranged during the French and Indian
war and when the representatives of the English government
entered the country affairs were in a chaotic state. The commandant
of the English troops had of course no authority to govern the
inhabitants. But he found himself face to face with conditions
which made immediate action imperative. Practically the only civil
officers Sterling found on the English side of the river were
Joseph La Febevre, who acted as Judge, Attorney General and Guardian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of the Royal Warehouse, and Joseph Labuxiere, was Clerk and
Notary Public.
<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
But those men retired with St. Ange and the French
soldiers to St. Louis shortly after the arrival of the English.
<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
This brought the whole governmental machinery to a standstill, and
the English commander was forced to act. He determined to appoint
a judge and after consulting the principal inhabitants of the villages,
selected M. La Grange, who was intrusted "to decide all
disputes according to the Laws and Customs of the Country," with
liberty to appeal to the commandant in case the litigants were dissatisfied
with his decision.
<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
The captains of militia seem to
have retained their positions under the British, their duties being
practically the same as in the French regime. Each village or
parish had its captain who saw to the enforcement of decrees and
other civil matters as well as looking after the local militia.
<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
The office of royal commissary continued and James Rumsey, a former
officer in the English army was appointed to this position.
<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
But who was to continue the duties of the old French commandants
with both his civil and military functions? Obviously the most
logical person was the commanding officer of the English troops
stationed at the fort, with the difference that the former held a
special commission for the performance of these duties, while the
latter had no such authorisation. A further and more fundamental
difference lay in the fact that formerly the French had the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
to appeal to the Superior Council at New Orleans, while apparently
no such corresponding safeguard was given them by the new arrangement.</p>

<p>Sterling did not long retain command of the post
<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> for in December
he was superseded by Major Robert Farmer,
<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> his superior in
rank, who arrived from Mobile with a detachment of the 34th regiment,
after an eight months voyage. Their arrival was exceedingly
welcome to Sterling and his men since they were becoming greatly
embarrassed for lack of provisions, ammunition, and presents for
the Indians.
<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
When they left Fort Pitt in August, it had not been
thought necessary to transport more than sixty pounds of ammunition
inasmuch as Fort de Chartres was expected to yield a sufficient
supply, and both Gage and Sterling believed that Croghan, with his
cargo of supplies, would be awaiting the arrival of the troops at
the Illinois.
<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
Neither expectation was realized. Croghan was back
in the colonies prior to Sterling's arrival at the post, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the fort was transferred, it yielded neither ammunition nor other
supplies in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the troops.
<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>An assembly of three or four thousand Indians had been accustomed
to gather at the fort each spring to receive annual gifts
from the French. But the English had made no provisions for such
a contingency, which, coupled with the weakness of the garrison
and the recent hostility of the Indians, would probably lead to
serious complications. A possible defection of the Indians, therefore,
necessitated a large supply of military stores
<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> which it was
possible to obtain from the French merchants in the villages. The
latter agreed to furnish the soldiers with ammunition, on the condition
that other provisions would also be purchased,
<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> for which
the English alleged they charged an exorbitant price.
<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Sterling was
compelled to acquiesce, for the merchants had sent their goods across
the river where he could not get at them.
<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The large supply of provisions which the colony had produced
in former years seems to have decreased, at any rate it fell far
short of the expectations of the English officers. One officer
writes at this time that "they have indeed but little here, and
are doing us a vast favor when they let us have a Gallon of French
brandy at twenty Shillings Sterling, and as the price is not as yet
regulated the Eatables is in the same proportion."
<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The wealth of
colony had been considerably impaired since the occupation on account
of the exodus of a large number of French who disobeyed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
order of Sterling that all who desired to withdraw should give in
their names in advance. Taking their cattle, grain and effects across
the ferries at Cahokia and Kaskaskia, they found homes at
St. Louis and St. Genevieve on the Spanish side.
<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Probably a large
part of the emigrants left in the hope that in Louisiana they
might still enjoy their ancient laws and privileges,
<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and others
from fear lest the Indians, who were now assuming a threatening
attitude, might destroy their crops and homes.
<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>The acute situation of the garrison brought on by the dearth
of supplies continued through the winter and spring of 1765 and
1766.
<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Farmer estimated that all the provisions available amounted
to no more than fifty thousand pounds of flour and 1250 pounds of
corn meal,
<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
upon which the garrison could barely subsist till the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
following July; and a portion of this stock would have to be given
to the Indians, since representatives of the Indian department had
not yet appeared. These circumstances obliged Major Farmer to
send Sterling and his troops to New York by way of the Mississippi
river and New Orleans instead of up the Ohio river in accordance
with Gage's orders.
<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
In response to a series of urgent requests
for assistance, Gage employed a force of Indians to transport a
cargo to the Illinois,
<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
which reached Fort Chartres during the
early summer of 1766, by which time also representatives of the
English merchants at Philadelphia had arrived with large stores of
supplies.
<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
Henceforth we hear nothing further of a shortage of
provisions in the Illinois, for not only did the English merchants
import large supplies from the East, but cargoes were brought up
the Mississippi from New Orleans by the French;
<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and for a time the
English government itself transported the necessary provisions
from Fort Pitt.
<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Late in the summer of 1766 Farmer was relieved by
Lieutenant Colonel Reid, who arrived during the summer from Mobile
with another detachment of the thirty-fourth regiment.
<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Reid soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
became obnoxious to the people on account of his tyrannical acts,
many of which have been recorded in Colonel George Morgan's letter
book. His administration of affairs, however, continued over a
period of two years. In 1768 he was relieved by Colonel John
Wilkins who ruled the French for the next three years.</p>

in his <i>Hist. of Can.</i>, V, 25, takes an opposite view. He says
that the "high character claimed for Pontiac cannot be established."
"He can be looked upon in higher light, than the instrument
of the French officials and traders." On page 6 he declares that
"there is no evidence to establish him as the central figure organizing
this hostile feeling."</p>

Extract from the correspondence of D' Abadie with the
French commandants, Jan., 1764. <i>Can. Arch. Report</i>, 1905, I, 471.
Parkman, who made a careful study of the correspondence in the
French archives, came to the conclusion that the French officials
may be exonerated. Winsor holds a similar view in his <i>Mississippi
Basin</i>, 452. See also Cayarre, <i>Louisiana</i>, II, 101. Kingford, in his
<i>Hist, of Can.</i>, V, 69-74, places no dependence in D' Abadie's statements.
On the other hand he bases most of his argument upon a letter
of Loftus which he quotes at length, but gives no hint as to
its location, date, &amp;c. It is evidently not the letter written to
Gage, which is quoted above.</p>

Croghan in an unofficial capacity. See, however, Winsor,

Fraser's journey a year previous to Croghan's, which is obviously
an error.</p>

Maisonville, a Frenchman, and one Andrew, an interpreter
were among the whites. Shawnee and Seneca Indians also accompanied
the party. Note the error in Kingsford, <i>Hist. of Can.</i>, V, 116,
wherein Sinnot is said to have accompanied Fraser. Sinnot had been
sent about the same time from the south by Indian agent Stuart.
On arriving at the Illinois his goods were plundered and he was
finally forced to flee to New Orleans. Johnson to Lords of Trade,
Sept. 28, 1765, <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, VII, 765. Ibid., Nov. 16, 1765,
Ibid., p 776. Apparently Sinnott must have arrived at Illinois
after Fraser's departure for New Orleans, since Croghan implies
that the former was still at Fort Chartres while he was a captive
at Vincennes. See Croghan's Journal as printed in the <i>N. Y. Col.
Docs.</i>, VII, 780.</p>

Ibid. Sterling asserts that although Croghan claimed to
have made a peace with all the Illinois chiefs, he is assured that
not one was present at the peace conference in Ouiatanon, and that
his own sudden appearance at the village was the real cause of his
success. Sir William Johnson, in a letter to Croghan, Feb. 21, 1766,
(Johnson MSS, Vol. XII, No. 60.) casts doubt upon the representation
of Sterling. He says that it is easy to account for his motives,
and that he has written Gen. Gage fully upon the subject. The letter
referred to has probably been destroyed; at any rate it is not
in any of the large collections.</p>

ff. Capt. Sterling relates in his letter to Gage that he had considerable
difficulty in persuading St. Ange to surrender his ammunition
and artillery stores. The latter claimed he had positive
orders to surrender only the fort and a few pieces of artillery.
</p>
<p>
As to the time of Sterling's arrival, Parkman, II, 314, says
he arrived in the early part of winter, while Nicollet, in his
sketch of St. Louis, states that the fort was reached in mid-summer.
From the above references, there can be no doubt as to the exact
date.</p>

They could not have been ignorant of the existence of such
colonies in the ceded territory, for Sir William Johnson, who was
familiar with western conditions, was in constant correspondence
with the ministry, and such works as the <i>Histoire de Louisiana</i> by

statesmen.</p>

It is very curious that no reference occurs in Art. XV of
the Plan, which dealt with civil matters. "That for the maintaining
peace and good Order in the Indian Country, and bringing Offenders
in criminal Cases to due Punishment, the said Agents or
Superintendents, as also the Commissaries at each Post, and in the
Country belonging to each Tribe, be empowered to act as Justices
of the Peace in their respective Districts and Departments, with
all powers and privileges vested in such Officers in any of the
Colonies; and also full power of Committing Offenders in Capital
Cases, in order that such Offenders may be prosecuted for the
same; And that, for deciding all civil actions, the Commissaries
be empowered to try and determine in a Summary way all such Actions,
as well between the Indians and Traders, as between one
Trader and another, to the amount of Ten Pound Sterling, with the
Liberty of Appeal to the Chief Agent or Superintendant, or his
Deputy, who shall be empowered upon such appeal to give Judgement
thereon; which Judgement shall be final, and process issued upon
it, in like manner as on the Judgement of any Court of Common
Pleas established in any of the Colonies."</p>

Morgan notes something more than mere mention, since he
plays an important role in the affairs of the Illinois country
from 1765-1771. He was born in Philadelphia in 1741 and was educated
at Princeton college. Through the influence of his father-in-law,
James Baynton, he was admitted to the firm of Baynton and
Wharton and in 1765 became the western representative of the firm.
After his experiences in Illinois, Morgan served the Revolutionary
cause in the capacity of Indian agent. He died in 1810. See <i>Biography
of Col. George Morgan</i>, by Julia Morgan Harding, in the <i>Washington
(Pa.) Observer</i>, May 21, 1904.</p>

The British were not so well situated to command the trade
as the French had been. The Illinois post had always been the center
for the trade of the Missouri river region, but after the cession
of Illinois to England and the Foundation of St. Louis by La
Clede in 1764, the latter place became the centre for the trade of
that region.</p>

Ibid., "As long as Skinns and Furrs bear a high price at
New Orleans they will never be brought to a British Market. The
Indian Trade in general from the observations I have made, will
always go with the stream, and the whole will either go down the
St. Lawrence or Mississippi Rivers." Gage to Johnson, Jan. 25,
1767, Johnson MSS, XIV, No. 28. "I am entirely of your opinion
concerning the Trade, &amp;c. by way of the Mississippi whilst the
Traders find better markets at New Orleans." Johnson to Gage, Jan.
29, 1767, Johnson MSS, Vol. XIV, No. 35. Also Johnson to Gage,
Feb. 24, 1767, Johnson MSS, XIV, No. 67. "So long as New Orleans
is in the hands of another power, the whole produce of the western
country must center there. For our merchants will always dispose
of their peltry or whatever the country produces, at New Orleans
where they get as good a price as if they were to ship them off."
Phym to Johnson, Mobile, April 15, 1768, Johnson MSS, Vol. XXV,
No. 109. "The Traders from these Colonies say it will answer to
carry Goods down the Ohio, but that it will not answer to return
with their Peltry by the same route, as they can get to Sea at so
much less expense, &amp; greater expedition by means of Rapidity of
the Mississippi, and pretend that they have Ships at New Orleans
to transport their Peltry to England." Gage to Shelburne, Jan.
17, 1767, B. T. Papers, Vol. XXVII, Pa. Hist. Soc. Lib. "The Peltry
gained by the Traders from Canada, whether on the Mississippi
or on the Ouabache we may be satisfied generally goes down the St.
Lawrence River to Quebec: it has been the usual track of those
Traders from the beginning, &amp; there is no reason to suspect the
contrary now. But the British Traders at the Ilinois who carry
their Goods above three hundred miles by land before they have the
convenience of Water or Carriage cannot afford to return the same
way, with the produce of their Trade." Gage to Hillsborough, Nov.
10, 1770, Pub. Rec. Office, A. &amp; W. I., Vol. 126. That this state
of affairs continued through most of the period is evident from the
following: "The Trade of the Mississippi, except that of the upper
parts from whence a portion may go to Quebec, goes down that River;
and has, as well as everything we have done on the Mississippi, as
far as I have been able to discover tended more to the Benefit of
New Orleans than of ourselves. And I conceive it must be the case,
as long as the Commodities of the Mississippi bear a better price
at New Orleans than at a British Market." Gage to Dartmouth, May,
5, 1773, Pub. Rec. Office, A. &amp; W. I., Vol. 128.</p>

Hutchins, Remarks on the Country of the Illinois, MS in Pa.
Hist. Soc. Lib. Hutchins gives an account of the exports from Illinois
from Sept. 1769 to Sept. 1770. In that year 550 packs of
peltries were sent from Illinois, while from the Spanish side 835
packs were exported. Wilkins, the commandant at Fort Chartres at
this time, makes a somewhat higher estimate, but the two agree in
essentials.</p>

Gage to Johnson, Jan. 19, 1767, Johnson MSS, Vol. XIV, No.
23, Captain Forbes, commandant at Fort Chartres during part of
1768, wrote to Gage: "As I am very sensible of the immense expence
this Country is to the Crown &amp; the little advantage the Public has
hitherto reaped by the trade with the savages, &amp; the reason is
that the inhabitants have continued to send their Peltry to New
Orleans which is shipped from thence to Old France &amp; all the money
that is laid out for the Troops and Savages is immediately sent to
New Orleans, for which our Subjects get French Manufactures. I
hope, Sir, you will excuse me when I observe to Your Excellency,
that the Crown of Great Britain is at all the expence &amp; that France
reaps the advantages." Forbes to Gage, April 15, 1768, Pub. Rec.
Office, A. &amp; W. I., Vol. 124. Commandant Wilkins wrote the same
year, "the French of New Orleans are the sole gainers in this
Trade and the public suffer greatly thereby." Wilkins to Gage,

I have found no account of any further activity on the
part of the company. In 1774 a copy of the correspondence was
sent to the Earl of Chatham, which may have been done in the hope
that his interest might be aroused in the undertaking. The bundle
of papers contains the following indorsement: "Mississippi Cos.
papers, sent to the Right Honble William Earl of Chatham, on Saturday
the 20th of April 1774. Charles Lee, in speaking of this
undertaking, said: "Another society solicited for lands on the
lower part of the Illinois, Ohio or on the Mississippi: this was
likewise rejected; but from what motives it is impossible to define,
unless they suppose that soldiers invested with a little landed
property, would not be so readily induced to act as the instruments
of the oppression of their fellow subjects, as those whose
views are solely turned, if not reduced, to farther promotion; and
if reduced, to full pay." The Lee Papers, N. Y. Hist. Soc. Colls.,

Alden, New Government West of the Alleghanies before 1780,
p 12. Mr. Alden notes a pamphlet published in London entitled "Advantages
of a Settlement upon the Ohio in North America," and another
pamphlet issued at Edinburgh in 1763 entitled "Expediency of
Securing our American Colonies." In the same connection the following
is of interest: "As the happy possession of the Illinois Country
is the Subject of much conversation, both in England &amp; America,
we beg leave to inclose,—a small pamphlet, wrote lately on a very

George Croghan who was in London in 1764 wrote: There is a
talk of setleing a Colony from the mouth of the Ohio to the Ilinois,
which I am tould Lord Halifax will Desier my opinion of in a few
Days. Mr. pownal tould me yesterday that I would be soon sent for
attend the board of Trade. what Meshures they will Take Lord knows

answer questions relative to a new colony. Whether he was finally

Johnson to Lords of Trade, Jan. 31, 1766, N.Y. Col. Docs.,
VII, 809. When Croghan was preparing to go to the Illinois in 1766
in order to pacify the Indians, Johnson wrote him as follows: "As
soon as I hear farther from the General I shall write you and send
the Instructions in which I shall insert an Article directing you
to enquire into the French bounds &amp; Property at the Illinois. I
have no objection to what you propose on that subject there, and
as the French are now said to be retiring fast, you will have the
better opportunity of making a good Choice on which the value will
chiefly depend." Johnson to Croghan, Mar. 28, 1786, Johnson MSS, XII, 126.</p>

Gage to Conway, Mar. 28, 1766, B. T. Papers, Vol. XX. Pa.
His. Soc. Lib. He explained further "that Lands should be granted
without delay, by any Person authorized properly to do it; but no
Fees are to be taken by the Person who grants, or by Secretarys,
Clerks, Surveyors, or other Persons whatever; that no large tracts
should be given, but the Lands granted in Farms, consisting of an
Hundred &amp; Fifty or Two Hundred Acres of good Land, unless to Half
Pay Officers, who might have Four or Five Hundred Acres. People
may be tempted on these Advantages to transport themselves with a
Year's Provisions, Seed, Corn and Tools for Husbandry, down the
Ohio. The Lands shall be held of the King on condition of Military
Service, &amp; such other obligations as shall be convenient." To anticipate
somewhat, the details thus outlined by Gage are in striking
contrast to those proposed by the active promoters of the
colony.</p>

Blouin, a wealthy merchant and later a prominent advocate of a civil
government, J. B. Beanvais, Charleville and others. Gage granted
their request without waiting for an answer from London, thus

Monette, in Hist. of the Valley of the Mississippi, I, 411,
says that "Capt. Stirling died in December, St. Ange returned to
Fort Chartres, and not long afterward Major Frazer, from Fort Pitt
arrived as commandant." Billou, in Annals of St. Louis, I, p 26,
makes the same assertion. The statement is an error, since Sterling
served in the Revolutionary war, and lived until 1808. Frazer
never commanded at Fort Chartres. See Winsor, Narr. &amp; Crit. Hist.
VI, 706. For a sketch of Sterling's career see N. Y. Col. Docs.,

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
